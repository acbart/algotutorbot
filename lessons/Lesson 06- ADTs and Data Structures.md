# Do

You are going to create a guide about Abstract Data Types and Data Structures. This will require both research and
creativity!

You MAY work together with anyone from your group (no limit on number of people). Clearly indicate who you worked with
on your guide. Many hands make short work, but recognize that artistic visions can vary. You may find partners more
effective than large teams.

We have provided a basic template that you can use: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COGMdrxpPuzAuw_DZIhbq-
TyjE5ZA9Bksh7OGscbRT0/edit?usp=sharing>

However, you are strongly encouraged to restructure your guide however you see fit! This is a chance to be creative and
really reformat the information whichever way you want. You really aren't limited to the two ugly tables we showed you.
Ideally, create something that you could imagine hanging on your wall.

The final version must still cover the same ADTs and Data Structures, and also cover the same content about them, as
described below:

  * Abstract Data Types: 
    * Description: A clear, human-friendly description of the ADT
    * Example Use Case: An example of a scenario where you might want to use this ADT
    * Common Operations: A list of the operations that the ADT should cover, with some indication of the input and output types
    * Implement With: A list of data structures that are appropriate for implementing the ADT in general, and also specifically what data structure you would probably use in Python to achieve this.
  * Data Structure: 
    * Description: A clear, human-friendly description of the ADT
    * Efficient for: A list of the major operations/characteristics that this data structure excels at
    * Inefficient for: A list of the major operations/characteristics that this data structure is poor at.

Do not simply copy/paste information you find online. Spend a little time to make sure things are nice and readable.
Anything you submit should reflect your understanding of the data structures and ADTs involved. Extra credit is
available for particularly well-crafted and helpful guides!

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:

  1. Whether all information is accurate
  2. Whether it is sufficient information to describe the algorithms
  3. Whether you covered all the data structures and Abstract Data Types

Submit a PDF of your finalized version here on Canvas. If the PDF format doesn't make sense for your final version, get
in touch with Dr. Bart about it.

Be sure to clearly identify who you worked with!
