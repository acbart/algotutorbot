# Do

There is nothing to do. You are done now. This was it! I hope you had a great semester, I know I did :)

Oh, if you're curious about the grade, I assigned participation points based on Discord activity, office hours attendance, OhYay attendance, extra credit engagement, etc. It's a little rough as far as these things go, but I tried to skew it to people's advantages as much as was reasonable.
