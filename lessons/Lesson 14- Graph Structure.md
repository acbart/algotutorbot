# Do

Hello students,

Today, you will have a fun exciting worksheet to complete. Now that you have mastered everything related to graphs,
thanks to my expert lecturing, you should find this work to be trivial. Still, you should work with your groupmates.
Because for some reason, humans tend to like other humans. I'm not sure why, I don't like humans whether they are
in groups or alone. Go figure.

The questions are in this Google Doc: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWTw8-UTRgf2IwX3EeNH-hqi-TViDvHqbuVIizC0Y54/edit?usp=sharing>

Copy and share the Google Doc with your group mates.

### Things to Remember

* Wrong answers will be punished severely.
* Make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak. You should be friendly and professional.
* Do not simply copy/paste explanations you find online. Make sure your submission reflects your groupâ€™s shared understanding and is nicely readable.
* Readability and grammar matters. I am an Algorithm Tutoring Bot, not an Optical Character Recognizer.

### Submission

When your group is done, download the finalized version as a PDF and submit it on GradeScope here: <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1131403/>

Be sure to clearly identify your group members in the Google Doc AND on GradeScope!
