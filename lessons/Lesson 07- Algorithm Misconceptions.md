# Do

Today, you will be debating with your groupmates about various statements related to information about this course.

Your job, as a group, is to debate, label it as True/False/Meaningless, and then explain each statement.

The questions are in this Google Doc: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YfIxSduGP9iwS-ksh91LYQ_nsELDtKGXAaNp7gk91b4/edit?usp=sharing>

Copy and share the Google Doc with your group mates.

### Things to Remember

* This assignment is all about nuance. Here, the best kind of correct is technically correct.
* Make sure you clearly convey assumptions; you can give conditional answers with clarifications (e.g., “this is true IF …, but otherwise it is false BECAUSE...”).
* Make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak. You should be friendly and professional.
* If someone disagrees with the group wisdom, they can write a dissenting opinion below the group answer. However, it’s best to find common consensus.
* You do not have to provide links/citations, but they can seriously strengthen your argument.
* Do not simply copy/paste explanations you find online. Make sure your submission reflects your group’s shared understanding and is nicely readable.

### Submission

When your group is done, download the finalized version as a PDF and submit it on GradeScope here: <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1058687>

Be sure to clearly identify your group members in the Google Doc AND on GradeScope!
