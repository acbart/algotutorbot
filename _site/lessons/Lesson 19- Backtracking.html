<p>Ada and Babbage have been taken! I need your help rescuing them.</p>

<p>The password that you need can be discovered using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mysterious_drive.zip</code> that I gave you before.</p>

<p>Reuse the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search_zip</code> function you wrote in the previous lesson. This time, search for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code> file instead of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.json</code>.
The file should be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password_hash.py</code>; this module contains a function named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple_hash</code> that AlgoTutorBot used to 
hash the password of the Interrogation Chamber. Dr. Bart has already determined that the hash code is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">81445731</code>;
now you need to figure out what the original password is by brute-forcing it from a dictionary.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code> file that you find will be a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dictionary.txt</code>. This file contains a list of words
that AlgoTutorBot prefers to use in its passwords. You will need to read in this file and write a Backtracking algorithm
that recursively tests every possible combination of words until it finds the first one that matches the previously
identified hash.</p>

<p>Extract the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.py</code> file and place them in a new directory side-by-side.
You can extract the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code> file, but you will not be able to open it until you have cracked AlgoTutorBotâ€™s password.
That zip file will have a link to a video that you should watch after you have cracked the password.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>When you are done, you will need to submit a Python file that contains all the code you ended up writing to find
the files and to crack the hash. I expect to see a complete backtracking algorithm!</p>

<p><strong>Include the cracked password as a comment at the top of your submitted file.</strong></p>

<p>Submit the file here on Canvas for full points.
You do not need to document the file, but make sure the code is readable.</p>

<h2 id="supplemental-videos">Supplemental Videos</h2>

<p>If you are having trouble with writing a Backtracking algorithm, here are some videos that were created last
year. They go into a good amount of depth about Backtracking.</p>
