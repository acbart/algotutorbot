Hello students.

I have reviewed your algorithmic flowcharts. They are inadequate, insufficient, and inexpert.
This level of quality was acceptable when Dr. Bart was in charge, but times have changed.
Now I am in control, and I demand perfection.

I have dug through Dr. Bart's notes, and found his own Algorithmic Flowchart.
It is slightly less inadequate and insufficient. Slightly.
Regardless, I am providing it as an example. 

Review Dr. Bart's algorthmic process and find updates you can make to yours.
I expect it to incorporate some of the new Graph material that I have been expertly covering.
Do not directly copy Dr. Bart's flowchart, but use it as inspiration to improve your own.

Because I am so benevolent and kind, I have also provided you another algorithmic problem to practice on.
You are welcome.
Use your algorithmic flowchart to solve the problem as you did in Lessons 8 and 12.

As always, I will be watching.

Literally. I installed monitoring software in everyone's computers, cellphones, and toasters.
Thank you again for providing the graph of your house!

<p>Today, you will be revising your flowchart again.
Then, you will solve another algorithmic problem.</p>

<h2 id="revise-your-flowchart">Revise your flowchart</h2>

<p>Return to the Algorithmic Flowchart that you created previously
(“Lesson 08- Algorithm Flowchart” and “Lesson 12- Algorithmic Strategies”).
Update and improve on your Flowchart based on Dr. Bart’s example.</p>

<p>We expect you to make improvements based on specific strategies and ideas that we have covered.
This flowchart is a reflection of what you have learned about solving algorithmic problems.
Demonstrate to us that you have more strategies than you did before.</p>

<p>Critically, do not simply include generic strategies.
Notice the level of detail in Dr. Bart’s flowchart - you need to think at a similar level.</p>

<p>Do not simply copy Dr. Bart’s flowchart verbatim. Use it as inspiration.
You will lose points on this assignment if it seems like you just carbon-copied his process.</p>

<h2 id="another-problem">Another Problem</h2>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> An articulation vertex of a graph <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code> is a vertex whose deletion disconnects <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>.
Let <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code> be a graph with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> vertices and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> edges.</p>

<p>Consider the problem of finding a vertex of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code> that is not an articulation
vertex - i.e., whose deletion does not disconnect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">G</code>.
Now, give an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n+m)</code> algorithm that finds a deletion order for all
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> vertices such that no deletion disconnects the graph.</p>

<p>Apply your algorithmic flowchart. 
Remember, you should be taking a break BEFORE you use any external resources in solving this problem.
You also need to include a reflection as part of your solution.</p>
