<p>Today, you will be revising your flowchart.
Then, you will solve another algorithmic problem.</p>

<h2 id="revise-your-flowchart">Revise your flowchart</h2>

<p>Return to the Algorithmic Flowchart that you created two weeks ago
(“Lesson 08- Algorithm Flowchart”).
Update and improve on your Flowchart as you see fit. We expect you to make
improvements based on specific strategies and ideas that we have conveyed over
the past couple weeks.
This flowchart is a reflection of what you have learned about solving problems.
Demonstrate to us that you have more strategies.</p>

<h2 id="another-problem">Another Problem</h2>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Design (and clearly explain) an algorithm to find the second largest element
in an unsorted array. Your algorithm should use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n + O(log(n))</code> comparisons of elements on an array of size <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>.
You may use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code> space as well.</p>

<p>Apply your algorithmic flowchart. 
Remember, you should be taking a break BEFORE you use any external resources in solving this problem.
You also need to include a reflection as part of your solution.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>Upload the following to GradeScope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1078617/">https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1078617/</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>The latest version of your Algorithmic Flowchart</li>
  <li>Everything you wrote down while solving the problem (including reflections)</li>
</ol>

<p>All files should be in PDF format.</p>
