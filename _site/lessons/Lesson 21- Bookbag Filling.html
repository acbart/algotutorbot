<p>Babbage needs your help filling up his bookbag with valuable items!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read in a file containing a maximum capacity and items’ names, weights, and value</li>
  <li>Find the subset of items that maximize the value while keeping the minimum equal to or below the threshold capacity</li>
  <li>Print out the list of items and their total value</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="formal-specification">Formal Specification</h1>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Identify the subset of items that will maximize their value while keeping their total weight equal to or below a threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong> The filename of a local file containing a sequence of items, each on their own line.
The first line contains the number of total items in the facility.
The second line specifies the maximum <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capacity</code> of the bookbag.
All subsequent lines describe the sequence of items and contain three elements.</p>

<p>An item’s information consists of the following information, separated by spaces:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The unique <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> of the item, without spaces and no more than 256 characters long.</li>
  <li>An integer specifying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weight</code> of the item</li>
  <li>An integer specifying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> of the item</li>
</ol>

<p>An example input file is below:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>5
15
Blueprints 4 50
HardDrive 10 2
DogFood 10 5
MysteriousCrystal 20 60
SuperComputer 100 100
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> The name of each chosen item on its own line, with the last line having the total value of the items.</p>

<p>An example of output is below:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Blueprints
DogFood
55
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="capacity">Capacity</h2>

<p>A critical aspect of this Problem is to understand that Babbage can only carry a certain amount of total weight.
We call this total weight the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capacity</code> of the bookbag. In the example above, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capacity</code> is 15. This means
that we can take:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Blueprints</code>, which weigh 4</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DogFood</code>, which weigh 10</li>
</ul>

<p>The total weight of these objects is 14, and their total value is 55. Notice that we take the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DogFood</code> instead
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HardDrive</code>, because Babbage believes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DogFood</code> is worth more (I mean, he is a dog).
The other two options cannot be considered because their weight is more than the capacity of the bag.</p>

<p>However, if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capacity</code> was instead 20, then the output would be:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>MysteriousCrystal
60
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The increased capacity means Babbage can now carry the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MysteriousCrystal</code>, which has a value of 60 and a weight of 20.
This is more than the combined value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BluePrints</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DogFood</code>, so he leaves them behind.</p>

<h2 id="time-complexity">Time Complexity</h2>

<p>Your solution must work in time complexity <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(nW)</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> is the number of items and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W</code> is the numerical size of the capacity.
Notice this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W</code> term - we are asking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-polynomial_time"><em>pseudo-polynomial time</em> algorithm</a>.</p>

<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>

<p>You will be submitting this assignment through GradeScope.
The same rules will apply for all coding assignments in this course, so you should read them all carefully: <a href="https://udel.instructure.com/courses/1563197/pages/gradescope-instructions">GradeScope Instructions</a></p>

<p>Critically, this is an individual assignment. Do not share code with any of your group mates!</p>

<p>For this project, you will need to create an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">answer.py</code> that solves the problem above, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readme.md</code> that
explains your solution at a high level, and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test.py</code> that tests your solution in some way.
Inside your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readme.md</code> file, make sure you clearly explain the <strong>algorithmic runtime</strong> of your program in terms of Big O.
For full credit, you must be able to justify your program’s complexity as worst case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(nW)</code>.</p>

<p>All parts of your solution, including both the program and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readme.md</code> file should be submitted on GradeScope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1189387/">https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1189387/</a></p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>You will be graded on the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>60% for a program passing the autograder’s unit tests</li>
  <li>30% for a clear explanation in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readme.md</code> file of the algorithmic runtime of your program.</li>
  <li>10% for having good unit tests</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that unclear code and answers can cause a huge penalty to your grade. We are not being strict on coding
style, but we shouldn’t have to run your code through a deobfuscator to figure out what it does.
You might also lose points if you ignore instructions in this assignment, or bypass the autograder, even if the autograder gives you points.</p>
