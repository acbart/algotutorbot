<p>Corrections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The proper math properties of Big Oh are available on the Wikipedia page (Product, Sum, Multiplication by Constant): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Properties (Links to an external site.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Slide 18 has Big Omega and Big Theta’s limit identity flipped. Big Omega requires a limit converging to greater than zero, while Big Theta requires a limit converging to less than infinity (aka an element of the reals) and greater than zero. Because it combines the criteria.</p>

<p>Today’s assignment is a series of mathematically-oriented questions about Big Oh, Big Omega, and Big Theta. You will make an individual submission, although you are strongly encouraged to work together with your cohort (please mark who you worked with!). Even together, you might find this to be quite challenging!</p>

<p>You can complete this assignment in one of two ways (your choice):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fill in this PDF, either by printing it out or using some other software: <a href="../assignments/Lesson 05- Bounds and Big Oh/Lesson 05- Bounds and Big Oh.pdf">Lesson 05- Bounds and Big Oh.pdf</a></li>
  <li>Use a LaTeX editor like Overleaf (though if you aren’t comfortable with LaTeX, this can be quite bothersome to learn): Lesson 05- Bounds and Big Oh.tex  Download <a href="../assignments/Lesson 05- Bounds and Big Oh/Lesson 05- Bounds and Big Oh.tex">Lesson 05- Bounds and Big Oh.tex</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We’re not going to teach you LaTeX, though if you ask questions on Discord we can try to provide some help. We’re more focused on helping you answer these questions.</p>

<p>Go to your cohort room by 9:30am!</p>

<p>Submission is via GradeScope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1039311/">https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1039311/</a></p>
