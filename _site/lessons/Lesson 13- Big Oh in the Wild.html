<h1 id="read">Read</h1>

<p>Read the following article: <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2021/02/16/arranging-invisible-icons-in-quadratic-time/">https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2021/02/16/arranging-invisible-icons-in-quadratic-time/</a></p>

<p>You do not need to read the comments at the bottom, just the article itself.</p>

<h1 id="do">Do</h1>

<p>Join the Ohyay room and find a partner work with. They may be outside of your group.
If it is 9:30am, and there are no possible partners left, then you may work alone.</p>

<p>Confirm that both partners have read the article, then choose a partner room in the Ohyay workspace where you can work together.
If someone has not read the article, make plans to meet up later to finish this assignment when you have both finished reading.</p>

<p>Make a copy of this Google Doc, and then work together to answer the questions: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_XmyFj76t03gm-7ZusjWMDCxveH-7FDk0gDYRegwsY/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_XmyFj76t03gm-7ZusjWMDCxveH-7FDk0gDYRegwsY/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>For all questions, I expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear, complete sentences</li>
  <li>Connections back to the course material, when appropriate</li>
  <li>Thoughtful responses that clearly demonstrate your understanding</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit your final version as a PDF on GradeScope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1078783/">https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1078783/</a></p>

<p>Be certain to identify your partner in the Google Doc AND on GradeScope.</p>
