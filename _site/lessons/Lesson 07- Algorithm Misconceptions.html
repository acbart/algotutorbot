<p>Today, you will be debating with your groupmates about various statements related to information about this course.</p>

<p>Your job, as a group, is to debate, label it as True/False/Meaningless, and then explain each statement.</p>

<p>The questions are in this Google Doc: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YfIxSduGP9iwS-ksh91LYQ_nsELDtKGXAaNp7gk91b4/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YfIxSduGP9iwS-ksh91LYQ_nsELDtKGXAaNp7gk91b4/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>Copy and share the Google Doc with your group mates.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This assignment is all about nuance. Here, the best kind of correct is technically correct.</li>
  <li>Make sure you clearly convey assumptions; you can give conditional answers with clarifications (e.g., “this is true IF …, but otherwise it is false BECAUSE…”).</li>
  <li>Make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak. You should be friendly and professional.</li>
  <li>If someone disagrees with the group wisdom, they can write a dissenting opinion below the group answer. However, it’s best to find common consensus.</li>
  <li>You do not have to provide links/citations, but they can seriously strengthen your argument.</li>
  <li>Do not simply copy/paste explanations you find online. Make sure your submission reflects your group’s shared understanding and is nicely readable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>

<p>When your group is done, download the finalized version as a PDF and submit it on GradeScope here: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1058687">https://www.gradescope.com/courses/230699/assignments/1058687</a></p>

<p>Be sure to clearly identify your group members in the Google Doc AND on GradeScope!</p>
