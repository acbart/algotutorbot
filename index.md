# Introduction to Algorithms with AlgoTutorBot

# SPOILERS HERE

If you are taking the class in Spring 2022, then you should not read this page any further! There are major story spoilers. I have changed the story in some places, but you might miss out on some smaller surprises!

In Spring 2021, I taught a really weird Algorithms course, with the help of a megalomaniac Intelligent Tutoring System. I was chased, punched, and duct taped to a chair. But I think my students learned a little bit about Big Oh notation, so it's kind of a mixed bag. Want to hear more?

~~Thanks for checking out all my materials! I have chosen not to upload some of them, to prevent them from being abused by students searching for answers. This mostly includes instructor unit tests and grading scripts, answer keys, and reference answers. If you are an instructor interested in these materials, please feel free to fill out this google form~~: [https://forms.gle/dU6U17Uy4QZ3KR577](https://forms.gle/dU6U17Uy4QZ3KR577)

Since I'm teaching the course again, I'm making some of my materials hidden. If you're taking the class, then I suggest you don't pry. Enough has changed that it won't help you, and you'll just ruin the story for yourself. Plus you could get in trouble for cheating if you dig too far!
