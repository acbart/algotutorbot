# Particularly Interesting Items

* [Runtime Case Builder](https://acbart.github.io/runtime-case-builder/?preload=RCB_find_with_break_dynamic.json): An interactive web application that let's students make graphs of algorithms' runtime. Students can control not only the algorithm, but also the cases and instances of input they use. Multiple cases of inputs can be visually compared against each other, e.g., to highlight different worst/best case behavior of algorithms. Check out this assignment for some [example questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxph3XW2O2fmrgDw7DmTnJzYo58CzZvorQG0eWJ8hks/edit?usp=sharing) you could use the Runtime Case Builder with. 
* Algorithmic Problem Solving Flowchart: I hypothesize that Algorithms courses that give feedback only on students' answers, rather than their problem-solving process, are emphasizing the wrong thing and are likely to encourage cheating. I have been experimenting with a scaffolded series of assignments where students develop a "flowchart for solving problems". This is *not* about making flowcharts that show an algorithm that solves a problem - this is about helping students to formalize their problem-solving strategies. The idea is first introduced in [Lesson 08](lessons/Lesson 08- Algorithm Flowchart), built further in Lessons [12](lessons/Lesson 12- Algorithmic Strategies), [17](lessons/Lesson 17- Flowchart Updates), and [22](lessons/Lesson 22- Pit Digging), and finally somewhat summatively assessed in [26](lessons/Lesson 26- Final Algorithmic Puzzles). An example of what a "flowchart" might end up looking like is available [here as an image](assignments/Algorithmic Flowchart Example-v2.pdf) (to prevent trivial copy/pasting). Note that the end result may not actually be a flowchart, but instead something more like a textual algorithm; the important part is that they concretize their thoughts, not that they produce a certain style of diagram!
* Point-and-click Graph Algorithm Adventure: In Lesson 16, students were directed to a special section of the Ohyay space that was modeled after my house. With spooky music playing and little context, they had to join together and explore the house to find me. Along the way, they find a video where I reveal that I have hidden some notes around the house that explain how they can determine the password to unlock the door to the basement. Basically, they have to execute a number of graph algorithms (e.g., Prim's, Djikstra's) using the house's rooms as a graph of vertices and edges. A walkthrough of the adventure can be found [here](lessons/Lesson 16- Graph Concepts).
